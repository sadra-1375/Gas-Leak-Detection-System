# Gas-Leak-Detection-System
Domestic gas leaks and incidents related to it are an unfortunate common thing and the only disadvantage of using this form of fuel for households. Annually at least 430 people die only from CO poisoning [1] and 4200 homes fell victim to Methane leaks and its consequence ignition all around the U.S. which on average take the life of 42 people every year [2] these figures are much higher for less developed countries which we donâ€™t have accurate data about them. All these problems can be easily prevented with GLaDis. This system detects both Methane and CO, inform resident, and if they want it will shut the main gas valve and prevent further gas leakage.
